# tuxio
Tuxio started as a project for my C programming course at school. It is a small, basic terminal video game.<br />
Simply download all files and "./tuxio"!

## Controls:
| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| WASD/NUMPAD | Movement |
| e | Fire Ice Spike |
| q | Fire fireball |
| SHIFT + q | Force the game-over screen |
  
## What Works:
| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Movement | Movement works as intended. User is able to control Tuxio with WASD or NUMPAD |
| Fireball | Fireball spawns and behaves as expected |  
| Ice Spike | Spike spawns and behaves as expected |
| Enemies | Enemies movement and automatic spawning works as intended |
| Losing | Game over screen is displayed when Tuxio collides with an enemy |
| Collision | Enemies killed by fireballs and ice spikes |
| Score Tracking | Score is tracked, +1 every time an enemy is killed |
| High Score | High score is stored in file "hiscore" |

## What Doesn't Work:
| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |

## Future:
| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| More Enemies | Ability to track up to 5 enemies, spawn randomly |
| More Enemies | Add different types of enemies that can only be affected by either ice or fire |

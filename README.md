# tuxio
Tuxio started as a project for my C programming course at school. It is a small, basic terminal video game. 

## Controls:
| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| WASD/NUMPAD | Movement |
| e | Fire Ice Spike |
| q | Fire fireball |
| SHIFT + q | Force the game-over screen |
| y |Force an enemy to spawn |
  
## What Works:
  Movement    - Movement works as intended. User is able to control Tuxio with WASD or NUMPAD <br />
  Fireball    - Fireball spawns and behaves as expected <br />
  Ice Spike   - Spike spawns and behaves as expected <br />
  Enemies     - Enemies movement and spawning works as intended <br />
  Losing      - Game over screen is displayed when Tuxio collides with an enemy <br />

## What Doesn't Work:
  Collision   - Enemies cannot be killed by fireballs or ice spikes <br />

## Future:
  More Enemies- Ability to track up to 5 enemies, spawn randomly <br />
  More Enemies- Add different types of enemies that can only be affected by either ice or fire <br />
